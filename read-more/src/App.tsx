/*
Problem Statement: Create a React component that displays a paragraph of text
and allows users to expand and collapse it. The component should display a truncated 
version of the text by default, with a button to toggle between "Read More" and
"Read Less". This improves readability and user experience for long content blocks.

  building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It allows
  developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and 
  render as data changes. One of Reactâ€™s key features is the virtual DOM, 
  which improves performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual
  DOM.`;
